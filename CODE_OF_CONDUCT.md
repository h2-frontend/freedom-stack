# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

Freedom Stack is committed to being a welcoming community that empowers developers to create with freedom and joy. We pledge to make participation in our project and community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Values

- **Approachability**: We believe in making web development accessible to everyone, regardless of their experience level. We welcome questions, encourage learning, and support those new to our stack.

- **Flow-ability**: We value simplicity and focus. Our community interactions should reflect this by being clear, helpful, and free from unnecessary complexity or gatekeeping.

- **Pocket-friendly**: We work hard to make full-stack web development financially accessible to everyone.

- **Generosity**: We believe that it is better to give than to receive, a lesson taught by Jesus in the Bible. While this project is created by a Christian, anyone can contribute to this project.
